# BPM: Project Manager Survival Kit for Blender

## 0 · Why does structure matter?

Imagine your project is a complex LEGO model. If you throw all the pieces on the floor, you will soon not know how they should connect. The structure of a project is the instruction manual: it decides where each piece lives, how it relates to the others, and how you can find it without wasting time.

**Organization ≠ Rigidity**: It's the skeleton that lets you move your arms without the body falling apart. This skeleton can grow and change to support a larger and more complex body.

**Structure = Speed**: With an organized project, you open the correct file, make your change, and close it, without wasting hours looking for “that good version of the rig that worked yesterday.”

With the BPM addon suite, we’re going to automate and simplify this order, but first, you need to understand the concepts.

## 1 · Full X-ray of an animated project

A 3D project is usually divided into three main acts. Think of them as preparing, cooking, and serving.

### 1.1 Pre-production – “Preparing the ingredients”

This is the planning phase. Here you define what will be done and how it will look. It includes:

* Concept and Script: The idea, the story, the characters.
* Concept Art and Design: Drawings that define the visual style, colors, atmosphere.
* Storyboard: A kind of comic that visualizes each shot of the animation.
* Animatic: A draft video made with the storyboard images and a temporary audio track. From here come the shot durations, their names, and the list of assets (characters, props, sets) you’ll need to create.

### 1.2 Production – “Cooking the main dish”

This is where Blender and BPM become your best friends. It’s the heart of the project: modeling, texturing, animating, lighting, and rendering.

#### 1.2.1 The Folder Tree: Your base of operations

Before saving your first .blend, you need a place to put it. BPM’s Tree Builder module creates a standard, professional folder structure with a single click.

**How to use it?**

* In Blender, go to File > Project Management > Plant the Tree.
* A file browser will open. Choose where you want to create your project.
* Name your project and customize the folders you need. Is it a still render? Uncheck “Animation” and “Sound.” Is it a full short film? Activate everything.

The tree generated by BPM might look like this:

```
/ProjectName/
├── 01_Pre-production/
│   ├── Script/
│   ├── Concept Art/
│   └── Storyboard/
├── 02_Production/
│   ├── Assets/
│   │   ├── Models/
│   │   │   ├── Characters/
│   │   │   ├── Scenarios/
│   │   │   └── Props/
│   ├── Scenes (Layout)/
│   ├── Animation/
│   └── Libraries/
│       ├── Textures/
│       ├── Addons/
│       └── Temp/  <-- BPM will use this folder!
└── 03_Post-production/
    ├── Renders/
    ├── Editing/
    └── Exports/
```

💡 Pro Tip: This tree is your starting point. Feel free to add or remove folders according to your needs. The key is to have a system and be consistent.

#### 1.2.2: Asset Lifecycle (The BPM method)

An asset is any reusable element: a character, a chair, a vehicle. Managing it is the backbone of the project. BPM sets up a clear and logical flow for its evolution.

**Step 1: Create the Master File (Placeholder)**
Even before modeling the first vertex, create the asset “container.” Let’s use the character Pepito.

* Open a new Blender file.
* In the Outliner, create a new collection and name it `00_Pepito_main`. The prefix `00_` is intentional: it ensures the collection always appears first in lists, making it easy to link.
* Drag the default cube into this collection. Right now, it’s a simple placeholder.
* Save the file in the appropriate assets folder (e.g. .../Assets/Models/Characters/) named `Pepito.blend`.

This file, although almost empty, is already functional. It can be linked into Layout or Animation scenes from day one to define composition and cameras—even if the character is just a cube. The collection `00_Pepito_main` is what will always be linked, acting as the “single source of truth” for the asset.

**Step 2: Incremental Versions (Work in Progress) vs. Backups**
Here it’s crucial not to confuse two different saving mechanisms:

* **Incremental Versions (Your daily work)**: Once your `Pepito.blend` file is saved, use Blender’s incremental save function to begin working (File > Save Incremental or the + in the save dialog). This will create files like `Pepito_001.blend`, `Pepito_002.blend`, etc.

When you reach an important milestone in a version—say `Pepito_005.blend`—you save over the master file by removing the numeric suffix, updating `Pepito.blend` to the latest stable version.

* **Blender Backups**: Every time you overwrite a file, Blender saves `.blend1`, `.blend2`, etc. These are not versions. They’re automatic safety backups used to recover from crashes or mistakes. They’re a lifeline, not a creative history.

**Pro Tip**: Go to Edit > Preferences > Save and Load and increase “Save Versions” to 6 to have a wider safety net.

**Step 3: BPM Naming Branches**
BPM’s file naming isn’t random; it’s designed so Blender Production Assistant can parse and generate coherent reports.

The full structure is: `[BRANCH]_[NAME]-[DETAILS]_[VERSION].blend`

Example: `02_Scene_26_shot_023-156_005.blend`

* `02_` (The Branch): A numeric prefix indicating a parallel development line. Used for drastic changes without affecting the main branch.
* `Scene_26_shot_023-156` (Name): A unique identifier. The hyphen (-) is useful to separate internal numbers clearly.
* `_005` (Version): Incremental work version in that specific branch.

**Default rules (implied naming):**

* No prefix `XX_` → branch 00 (main branch)
* No suffix `_XXX` → master file (stable main)

So, `Pepito.blend` is:

* Branch 00
* Master file of that branch
  This is the version linked into production, updated only with stable milestones. Daily work and experimentation happen in incrementals and other branches.

#### 1.2.3 Link vs. Append: the difference is Override

* **Link 🔗**: You bring in data from another .blend and use it remotely. If the original changes, all linked files are updated. This is the recommended flow, but it doesn't mean using append is wrong: sometimes, due to the nature of the scene or asset, append is necessary.
* **Append 📥**: You copy the data into your file. It no longer depends on the original. Useful when you don't need constant synchronization (although everything should stay in sync... if not, ask your TD 😉).

**Override 🛠️**: Allows editing of linked objects without breaking the link (e.g. moving bones in an external rig). Overrides live in your file; structural changes stay in the source.

#### 1.2.4 The .blend as Container: Data-Blocks and Fake User

A .blend file contains data-blocks: meshes, materials, textures, animations, etc.

💣 **The silent bomb**: If a data-block (like a material you made but didn’t assign) has no users, Blender will delete it next time the file is opened.

**Solution**: Click the shield icon (F) next to its name. This marks it with a “Fake User” and tells Blender: “Don’t delete this—I’ll need it later.”

#### 1.2.5 External Files: Don’t lose your textures!

A common issue: you move your project to another PC and all textures turn pink (missing!). This happens when using absolute paths (like `C:\Users\You\Desktop\...`) instead of relative ones.

Blender Production Assistant solves this elegantly:

* **Define your root**: In BPA’s panel (N-Panel), use **Select Project Root Folder** to tell it where your project lives.
* **Organize your textures**: Select your asset and press **Textures to Current Directory**. It will find external textures, copy them into a `/textures/` folder next to your .blend, and fix the paths to be relative. Your project is now 100% portable.

#### 1.2.6 Recovery and Temp Files: BPM’s crash insurance

Blender saves recovery files in a system temp folder—but this is wiped on restart.

BPM has a button **Save Temp in Project Tree**. Pressing it will store all auto-saves and recoverable files inside `/Production/Libraries/Temp/`.

#### 1.2.7 Link Health: Avoiding “Outsiders”

Your project should be a closed ecosystem. Linking assets from your Desktop is a recipe for disaster.

BPA can diagnose the state of assets linked to a scene:

**Health Semaphores**:

* 🟢 Green (OK): The linked file lives inside the project structure.
* 🟡 Yellow (Question): The file is outside the project tree. It’s a dangerous “outsider.”
* 🔴 Red (Error): The link is broken; the file can’t be found.

**Treatment**: The panel gives quick access to Link, Make Override, and generate status reports.

#### 1.2.8 Packaging: Preparing to travel

If you need to send a file to a render farm or external collaborator:

* **File > External Data > Pack Resources**: Packs all textures, HDRIs, etc., into the .blend. Heavier, but self-contained.
* **Getting it back?** Use **File > External Data > Unpack Resources** to reestablish links or extract files locally.

## 2 · From Artist to Supervisor: BPM’s Report System

This connects the whole team. BPM uses CSV files to implement a powerful, simple feedback loop.

### 2.1 The Artist: Reporting progress

* Open your asset (e.g. `01_pepito_005.blend`)
* Go to BPA tab in N-Panel > Asset Status
* Fill in:

  * Type: Character
  * Process: Rigging
  * State: WIP (Work In Progress)
  * Assigned To: YourName
  * Note: “Basic facial rig done. Weight review pending.”
* Click **Save Report**: Generates or updates `01_pepito report.csv` in the same folder as your .blend

You’ve now reported your status without leaving Blender.

### 2.2 The Supervisor: The Overseer Dashboard

* Open a blank Blender file
* Go to N-Panel > BPM tab > Overseer Dashboard
* Click **Load CSV Reports**. Select all `... report.csv` files from the root project folder
* Review dashboard: See all assets, assignments, status, and notes
* Give feedback:

  * Tick **Checked** box for approved assets
  * Add your own notes in **Note** column (e.g. “Shoulder weights need review.”)
* Click **Validate All Changes**: Saves your feedback back into the CSV files. Artists will see it next time they open the file

This system keeps communication centralized and traceable.

## 3 · Advanced Topics and Best Practices

### 3.2 Modular, Scalable Workflow

The philosophy behind all this is modularity.

* Don’t put everything in one .blend: split into assets and scenes
* Link as much as possible: Build scenes like LEGOs
* Use Collections: Group elements (CHARACTERS, SETS, LIGHTS). This helps isolate, hide, and manage complexity efficiently

### 3.3 Final Recommendations (Survival Checklist)

* [ ] Set project root with BPM at the start
* [ ] Avoid to move project files with OS explorer. If needed, relink properly
* [ ] Use relative paths. BPA helps with this
* [ ] Set Save Versions to 5 or 10. Disk is cheap—lost work isn’t
* [ ] Activate Fake User for data-blocks you want to keep
* [ ] Regularly back up full project (zip and store it safely)

## Future Implementations

* Project templates from JSON (Game, Short Film, Archviz, etc.)
* Reconnect packed links
* Relocate for outsiders
* Override resync / enforce
* Load backup (.blend1, .blend2…)
* Button to open referenced files in Overseer
