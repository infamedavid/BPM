ðŸŽ¬ Blender Project Management

Your pipeline, organized. Your creativity, unleashed.

From pre-production to final render, this two-addon system brings clarity and control to your Blender pipeline.
Blender Production Manager is your studioâ€™s backbone â€” it builds structured project folders and offers a powerful dashboard to track assets and teams via CSV.
Meanwhile, Blender Production Assistant empowers artists with hands-on tools to manage textures, overrides, backups, and reports â€” without leaving the viewport.

Whether you're a solo creator or part of a full team, this toolkit helps you stay focused on what really matters: making great work.
